manzuo.com and ftuan.com do not have shop information.
58.com does not have shop info as well... although it has shop address, but it's pretty vague.

to crawl deal information from lashou.com, python pipeline.py -s lashou
for other websites, we can use python async_pipeline.py -s meituan

Run the data collection and analysis pipeline:
python main.py
To end the process, create a file under the current directory called "main_term_sig"
